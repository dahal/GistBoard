GistBoard
=========

GistBoard is an easy to use Sinatra-based app that centralizes a users gists with comment totals by their side. GistBoard is gitHub-enabled, and user-inspired. To say we strived for instant access to your comments, only pre-confirms this very-- kind of-- true conversation.
 

```
Phil: What about when you know there is a comment somewhere between your first and last gist but you are not really sure where it is? 
Alex: Comments?
James: Comments, Alex. 
Phil: Like the ones you want to *check* but really aren't liking the idea of combing every single gist to find it.
Alex: Check? Cash? 
James: Ah, I like it. 
Alex: Check? Cash? Credit?
James: Stop it, Alex. You know'd use it.
```


GistBoard provides an overview of a userâ€™s GitHub gists and details. In a simple table, a summary of your gists are shown. Those details: gist name, link to gist, comment count, date of last comment, etc. 

**This is v1.**
