#GistBoard

This web app provides an overview of a userâ€™s GitHub gists and details. In a simple table, information is shown that details: gist name, link to gist, comment count, date of last comment, etc. For v1, our intention is to not utilize an explicit DB, but to store information in the browser session.


##User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to see the most recent comment on any of my gists (date)
2. As a user, I want to be able to see all of my gists in one place
3. As a user, I want to be able to see counts of: files, comments, stars, forks
4. As a user, I want to be able to click on the title/link of the gist and be taken to it
5. As a user, I want to be able to click on a gist title and expand it so that the gist content is displayed in an iframe type embedded element*
6. As a user, I want to be able to sort all my gists by certain table headings (i.e. title, date last modified, comments, stars, forks, files)
